This is a unique set of six C3D files created using ADTech AMASS software on a DEC PDP11 running the RSX11-M operating system in 1989. Each of the six files contain identical data and parameters in each of the C3D formats variants (DEC, Intel, and SGI/MIPS endian formats) in both floating-point and integer data types. These files can be used to verify that software applications read all of the six C3D file format variations correctly as all six files contain identical data values. A spreadsheet is included that documents the calculation of the POINT:SCALE factor for C3D files.

Each file has been generated from the same original data.

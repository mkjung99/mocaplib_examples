A C3D file in REAL (floating-point) DEC format containing 6,492 frames of human data generated
by Vicon 370 software and includes the Vicon created TRIAL group that defines the start and end
frame numbers.  All of the parameters in the file are unlocked, making data corruption a risk if
an application accidentally changes POINT:SCALE, POINT:RATE etc.  The subject steps onto the
force plate at the start of the recording and then balances on the plate for the remainder of
the trial - this is not an ambulatory gait trial.  The EMG data was recorded with an unknown
radio telemetry EMG system and is unusually noisy.

The bodybuilder.c3d is a large C3D file generated using Vicon "370" software and is stored in DEC REAL,
floating-point format.  The second file, sub_labels.c3d, uses an interesting form of labeling to 
identify two subjects for the 3D point data. This is stored in DEC integer format and some of the
calculated POINT variables show a loss of resolution as the data values approach the POINT:SCALE value.


bodybuilder.c3d   A single large c3d file generated using Oxford Metrics BodyBuilder software.
                  Stored in DEC-REAL format.

sub_labels.c3d    A file using subject labels for the point data.  This is stored in DEC-INT format and
                  some of the calculated POINT variables show a loss of resolution as the data values
                  approach the POINT:SCALE value.  Stored in DEC-INT format.

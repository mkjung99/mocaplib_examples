A set of C3D test files in Intel INT format data generated by Motion Lab Systems.  These files can be used to check that C3D compatible applications read the correct pointer values from the C3D header in block 1 of the C3D file. All files contain identical 3D and parameter data but place the parameter and 3D data sections in different locations.

A set of C3D test files containing human gait marker data and force plate data.  All files are Intel INT format data and contain contain identical 3D and parameter data although the location of the parameter block varies, it's location is defined by the C3D file header pointer.  Note that tests with some applications may fail to read TESTB, TESTC, and TESTD files indicating that the application is not using the C3D header record information correctly.

EB015PI.C3D
	A standard C3D file with the Header at block #1, a single parameter record
	start at block #2.  The 3D data record starts at block #11.

TESTAPI.C3D
	As above but with a standard C3D parameter header record where bytes 1,2
	of the parameter header are 0x00h.

TESTBPI.C3D
	Derived from TESTAPI.C3D, this C3D file has Header at block #1, but the
	parameter record starts at block #11, and the 3D data record starts at
	block #20.  All header pointers are set to indicate the correct record locations.
	This simulates an extra data block (0xFFh) located before the parameter section.

TESTCPI.C3D
	Derived from TESTAPI.C3D, this C3D file has Header at block #1, the parameter
	record starts at block #2, but an addition record of 9 blocks exists following
	the parameter record, the 3D data record starts at block #20.  All header
	pointers are set to indicate the correct record locations.  This simulates
	an extra data block (0xFFh) located after the parameter section.

TESTDPI.C3D
	Derived from TESTAPI.C3D, this C3D file has Header at block #1, the parameter
	record starts at block #7, and the 3D data record starts at block #20.  All
	header pointers are set to indicate the correct record locations.
	This simulates an extra data block (0xFFh) located prior to the parameter
	section together with a second extra data block following the parameter section
	and before the start of 3D data.
